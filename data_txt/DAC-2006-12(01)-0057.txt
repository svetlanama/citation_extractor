 Abstract ? The impact of process variation on SRAM yield has 
become a serious concern in scaled technologies. In this paper, we 
propose a methodology to analyze  the stability of an SRAM cell in 
the presence of random fluctuations in the device parameters. We 
provide a theoretical framework for characterizing the DC noise 
margin of a memory cell and develop models for estimating the cell 
failure probabilities during read  and write operations. The proposed 
models are verified against extensive Monte-Carlo simulations and 
are shown to match well over the entire range of the distributions 
well beyond the 3-sigma extremes.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Manufacturing variations can be classified as  systematic or 
random . Systematic variations are predictable in nature and depend 
on deterministic factors such as layout structure and surrounding 
topological environment [1]-[3]. On the other hand, random 
variations are unpredictable and are caused by random uncertainties 
in the fabrication process such as  microscopic fluctuations in the 
number and location of dopant atoms in the channel region [4],[5]. 
Random variations are harder to characterize and can have a 
detrimental effect on the yield of critical modules in a design.  
Random variations can cause a significant mismatch in 
neighboring devices and hence are largely responsible for the poor 
yield of the  static random access memory  (SRAM ) arrays in scaled 
technologies [6],[7]. SRAM yield is very important from an 
economic viewpoint due to the critical and the ubiquitous nature of 
memory in modern processors and SoCs. Density is a very important 
metric for memories and hence SRAM cells use the smallest 
manufacturable device sizes in  a given technology. However, the 
threshold voltage variation due to  random dopant fluctuation is 
inversely proportional to gate area [8]-[10]. Due to this dependence, 
the small sized transistors in a memory cell see a highly pronounced 
random dopant effect. Moreover, SRAM cells are traditionally 
designed to ensure that the contents of the cell do not get altered 
during  read access while the cell should be able to quickly change its 
state during the  write operation. These conflicting read and write 
requirements are satisfied by balanc ing the relative strengths of the 
devices in the design. Such careful design of an SRAM cell provides 
stable read and write operation, but it also makes the cell vulnerable 
to the failures caused by random vari ations in the device strengths. 
Due to increased sensitivity of  SRAM designs to process 
variation, failure analysis of a memory cell has become an extremely  important exercise. The electrical yield of a cell is typically analyzed 
through Monte-Carlo simulations whic
h treat the threshold voltage of 
each device in the cell as an independent random variable. However, 
the large number of simulations  required to obtain full stability 
coverage makes Monte Carlo  simulations computationally 
prohibitive. Reference [11] illustrat es this problem with an example 
of a 4 MB cache. The authors show that a typical 4 MB cache with 
error correcting code (ECC)  cells contains approximately 38 million 
cells. To ensure that there is at most one failure in this cache, the 
circuit must operate correctly up to 5.44 sigmas. This sort of fault 
coverage can only be verified by millions of simulations. 
Furthermore, Monte-Carlo simulations provide little insight to the 
designer about optimizing cell yield in subsequent iterations. A 
modeling based approach, on the other hand, can not only be used to 
estimate cell failure probability in an efficient manner, but it can also 
guide cell optimization for yield enhancement.  
Analytical modeling of SRAM cell stability is not an entirely 
new concept. Earlier work in th is field focused on characterizing 
SRAM robustness by modeling  Static Noise Margin (SNM) of the 
cross-coupled inverters in a memory  cell [12],[13]. More recently, 
there have been efforts in character izing cell stability during read and 
write operations [14],[15]. Most of these works rely on device 
equations to solve for parameters such as SNM,  read disturbance and 
inverter trip-point . In this work, we propose a simple and accurate 
method for modeling read, write and access time failure probabilities 
of an SRAM cell. First, we provide a theoretical framework for 
computing DC noise margins and de monstrate that the noise margin 
is better characterized by computing the loop gain of the crosscoupled inverters in the memory cell. We apply the loop-gain 
concept to the read stability problem and develop a read stability 
metric called  read noise margin (RNM) . We show that RNM has a 
Gaussian distribution and can be easily modeled as a linear function 
of the random parameter variations in different transistors in the cell. 
Similar to Reference [14], we also make an observation that the write 
failures occur due to timing violati ons. However, Reference [14] tries 
the model the non-Gaussian distribution of the 
write delay  with a 
Non-Central F  distribution. We show that  the inverse of write and 
access delays also follow Gaussian distributions and can be 
characterized by sensitivity-based  linear models. We use these 
models to analyze different failure mechanisms. In the proposed 
formulation, the various failure pr obabilities are directly expressed as 
functions of the parameter fluctua tions in different devices, which 
allows us to analyze sensitivities of  different failure mechanisms to 
underlying sources of variation and  enables efficient computation of 
joint failure probability of a memory  cell. This work focuses on the 
analysis of conventional 6-T SRAM cell as shown in Figure 1.

(SNM) of an SRAM cell.  
 
II. DC NOISE MARGIN 
The noise margin of an SRAM cell is defined as the minimum 
amount of DC noise required to flip the state of the cell. 
Traditionally, it is modeled by measuring the side of the longest 
square that can be inscribed between mirrored DC characteristics of 
the cross-coupled inverters in a me mory cell. However, as shown in 
Figure 2, this noise metric, ca lled static noise margin (SNM), 
assumes that the two storage nodes in the cell are subjected to equal 
and opposite DC noise offsets [12], [13]. Reference [16] shows that 
the SRAM noise margin can also be characterized by modeling the 
cross-coupled inverters as a positive feedback loop system. The 
authors show that the cell is on the ve rge of instability if its loop gain 
is unity. In this section, we ge neralize the loop gain concept and 
propose a new criterion for quantifying cell stability in the presence 
of DC noise offsets.  
We begin by considering the case of an SRAM cell which stores 
a value (V
L = 0 and VR = 1). Let us assume that a DC noise 
disturbance at node  L causes its potential V
L to rise above zero. Our 
objective is to find the minimum DC noise disturbance at node  L
 that 
causes the cell to lose its state. Let us assume that the DC transfer 
characteristics of the  PR-NR and the  PL-NL inverters (as labeled in 
Figure 1) can be modeled by functions  f and  g respectively. For a 
symmetric cell, the two functions sh ould be identical, but they will 
differ due to random mismatches in the device characteristics.

Due to the non-linear nature of  the transfer-characteristics f and 
g,  the gains of the two inverter stages depend on their input voltages. 
Hence a disturbance at node  L causes a change in the gain of the  PRNR  stage. A noise offset at node  L also changes the potential at node 
R  and hence impacts the gain of the feedback stage. The loop gain of 
the system as a function of node  L potential can be expressed as:

Figure 3 shows the gains of individual stages and the loop gain as 
a function of V

loop gain to become unity. This value, labeled as V
L (flip) in the figure, 
represents the minimum DC potential  required to flip the contents of 
a cell. In other words, V
L (flip) is the maximum potential that can be 
tolerated by node  L without altering its state from zero to one.  
Figure 4 shows the significance of V
L (flip) in analyzing the noise 
margin of an SRAM cell. The figure  shows the butterfly curves of the 
cross-coupled inverters as modeled by Equation 1. The figure also

( Noise
L). For a small noise offset, the cell maintains its state because 
it has a stable operating point in  the vicinity of the initial state (V
L = 0 
and V
R = 1). However, as the noise is  increased, the shifted curve 
moves far enough such that it intersects the forward inverter 
characteristics at only one point (as labeled  P in Figure 4). If the 
noise is increased beyond this point, then the cell will lose its state 
because the two DC characteristics will not have a stable intersection 
point required to maintain the initial state. The state of the cell, when 
the two curves barely touch each other and the cell is on the verge of 
instability, is defined as  metastable state. Interestingly, the potential 
at node  L in the metastable state is V
L (flip). Based on this observation, 
we define the noise margin of the cell as:

Next, we consider the case when the cell still stores a value (V
L = 
0 and V
R = 1) but a negative DC noise disturbance is applied at node 
R.  The negative disturbance causes node  R?s potential to fall below 
one. Similar to Equation 2, the loop gain of the system as a function

The above noise margin metric is different from SNM because it 
characterizes a cell?s stability under  the assumption that only side of 
the cell is disturbed by external noise. SNM, on the other hand, is a 
measure of noise margin when si multaneous positive and negative 
DC noise offsets are present at the two nodes of the cell. SRAM 
failures due to  read noise and also due to  alpha particle strikes 
usually occur due to one-sided disturbances. Therefore, the noise 
margin model of Equation 6 is more useful in checking cell stability 
in the presence of DC noise offsets. However, for the sake of 
completeness, we extend the above  loop-gain concept to model cell 
stability in the presence  of noise disturbs at both ends of a cell.  Once again we consider the case of an SRAM cell storing a value 
(V
L = 0 and VR = 1). However, this time we assume that both nodes 
in the cell are subjected to external disturbances. When V
L and VR 
can take any possible values, the loop gain of the system as a 
function of node  L and node  R potentials can be expressed as:

Now, if we assume  that a positive noise ( NoiseL) is applied at the 
node  L (storing zero) and a negative DC offset ( Noise
R) occurs at 
node  R (storing one), then the SRAM stability criterion in the 
presence of double-sided noise can be formulated by checking the

Figure 7 demonstrates the stable and the metastable state of a cell 
in the presence of double-sided no ise. The figure shows that noise 
offsets at nodes  L and  R result in a horizontal and vertical shift in the 
transfer characteristics of the two inverters. In the metastable state, 
the combination of  Noise
L and NoiseR shifts the butterfly curves such 
that they intersect at only one point.  In this state, the cell is on the 
verge of instability as a small amount of additional noise will change 
the contents of the cell.    
III. READ STABILITY FAILURES 
An SRAM cell is most prone to failure during read operation. A 
read operation in SRAM typically involves precharging the bitlines 
followed by reading the contents  of the cell through the access 
transistors. When the access transistors are turned on, one of the 
precharged bitlines discharges through the access device and the 
inverter pull-down transistor. For example in Figure 1, during a read 
access, the bitline  BL will discharge through the access device  AL 
and the pull-down device  NL to read a zero at node  L. This method of 
reading cell contents exposes the internal storage node  L to the 
disturbance caused by the resistive voltage division between the 
access and the pull down devices. Typically, this disturbance is 
minimized by making the pull-down device much stronger than the 
access transistor. However, random variations in the threshold 
voltages and therefore the strengths of various devices in an SRAM 
cell can cause the read operation to f lip the contents of the cell. These 
failures are defined as  read stability failures.  
 
59

In the previous section, we discussed the stability of a cell in the 
presence of a positive disturbance at the node storing zero. 
Conceptually, read stability failures can be analyzed in a similar 
manner. The DC noise analysis is  valid because the read access time 
is usually larger than the time requ ired to flip the state of the crosscoupled inverters. When the wordline (WL) is turned on, a noise 
voltage is immediately developed at the internal node of the cell. The 
WL stays high for duration long enough for the bitline to discharge 
by a specific value. During this period, if the DC noise voltage at the 
internal node is large enough to flip the contents of the cell, the cell 
loses its state resulting in the read stability failure.  
The read stability of a cell can  be analyzed by computing the 
loop gain of the system in read mode. The forward and the feedback 
characteristics are computed by including access devices along with 
the inverters as shown in Figure 8. Let us assume that the transfer 
characteristics of the  PR-NR-AR and the PL-NL-AL  stages can be 
modeled by functions  f 
R and  gR respectively. Similar to Equation 2, 
the loop gain of the system as a function of node  L potential (V
L) can 
be expressed as:

The concept of read noise margin  (RNM) is demonstrated in the 
right half of Figure 8. RNM is a useful metric in analyzing read 
stability failures. A positive value of  RNM represents a stable read 
operation while a zero or negative value of RNM signifies that the 
read operation will cause the cell to lose its state resulting in the read 
stability failure.  
We characterize the impact of random variations on RNM 
through SPICE-based Monte-Carlo simulations in an industrial 65 
nm technology. The simulations model the threshold voltage of each 
device in the cell as an independent random variable. The threshold 
tolerances for different devices in the cell are chosen from the 
technology specifications and include the dependence of sigma-V
T 
on device width. Figure 9 shows the histogram and the quantilequantile (Q-Q) plot of RNM. The  observed Gaussian nature of RNM 
indicates that it can be well modeled as a simple linear model.

IV. WRITE FAILURES 
Write failures are caused when a SRAM cell fails to write a 
desired state in a cell during the  write operation. The write operation 
in an SRAM cell is performed by  setting the bitlines to the desired 
values and enabling the access transi stors to drive the internal nodes 
of the cell. For example in Figure 1, a zero is written at the node  R by 
driving bitline  BR low and setting the wordline high. The resistive 
voltage division between the pull-up device  PR and the access 
transistor  AR pulls the internal node  R to zero causing the cell to 
change its state. Typically, a stro nger write capability is achieved by 
making the pull-up device weaker than the access transistor.  
For a successful write, node  R must be pulled low within the 
duration when the wordline is high. The write failure probability ( P
W) 
can therefore be expressed as

condition in Equation 15 is same as the write failure criterion 
proposed in [14]. Figure 10 shows the histogram of  T
W as obtained 
from 100,000 Monte-Carlo simulations. It can be seen from the 
figure that the  T
W distribution has a tail and cannot be approximated 
with a normal distribution. Write failures usually occur in the tail 
region and hence modeling that region well is critical for an accurate 
analysis of the write failure pr obability. Reference [14] suggests 
modeling the tail with a  non-central F distribution. To first order, the 
delay can be expressed using the alpha-power law model [17].

the inverse dependence of delay on the  (V

a transformation  T on delay  D defined as()?1:?? D

T, then the 
transformed value of delay becomes a linear function of  (V

The write failure analysis can now  be performed in the transformed 
domain with an advantage that  the timing variable in the write 
stability constraint varies linearly with the threshold voltages. For 
example, for exponent 
?=1, a simple transformation (D
D
T 1
: ?) is 
sufficient to achieve linearity. In  this work, we use this inverse 
transformation but other transformations with non-unity values of 
? 
can also be used in a similar manner. 
Figure 11 shows the distribution of (1/ T
W) and compares it to a 
normal distribution. The figure shows that (1/ T
W) can be 
approximated with a normal distribution. The observed Gaussian 
nature of the inverse of write delay indicates that it can be modeled 
with a simple linear model:

V. READ ACCESS FAILURES 
During the read operation, the wordline is activated for a limited 
duration as determined by the cell access time. Read access failures 
occur if the contents of the cell cannot  be read within this duration. In

large enough to trigger the sense amplifier within the wordline 
duration. Read access fails are timing failures and can be modeled 
like write failures. Figure 12 shows that the inverse of access time 
(1/ T
A) can be approximated with a normal distribution. The inverse of 
access time can therefore be modeled as:

VI. JOINT FAILURE PROBABILITY 
The stability criteria proposed in Sections III, IV and V express 
each failure probability as a linear function of the independent 
sources of variation. The joint failure probability of an SRAM cell 
can be computed by combining the different criteria in a multivariate 
normal distribution. For read stabilit y, write, and read access failures, 
the trivariate density function can be expressed as:

VII. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
The models proposed in the paper were verified on an SRAM 
design in an industrial 65nm, 1V, SOI technology [18]. In our 
simulations, we modeled the V
T of each device in the cell as an 
independent random variable. The th reshold tolerances were chosen 
from the technology specifications and include the dependence of 
sigma-V
T on device width. The models were characterized by 
computing the nominal values and the sensitivities of the read noise 
61

margin (Equation 13), the inverse of write delay (Equation 17), and the 
inverse of access time (Equation 19) with respect to V
T variations in all 
six transistors. We computed the sensitivities by varying the V
T of one 
transistor at a time while keepi ng the threshold voltages of other 
devices in the cell fixed at their nominal values. Alternatively, the 
sensitivities can also be  computed by performing linear regression on a 
small number of Monte-Ca rlo simulations. The number of simulations 
required to generate linear models is significantly smaller than the 
Monte-Carlo simulations needed to  verify the stability of an SRAM 
design. Table I shows the computed  sensitivities when attempting to 
read a zero at node  L or write a zero at node  R. The sensitivities 
represent the relative importance of  each transistor in analyzing the 
three failure mechanisms discussed in the paper. The table shows that 
while it may be possible to analyze the read access failures by 
considering only the correspondi ng access and the pull-down device, 
both the read stability and the write failures must consider the V
T 
variations in all six devices for  accurate prediction of the failure 
probabilities. 
The proposed models were verified through SPICE based MonteCarlo simulations. To ensure th at the cell stability criteria are 
checked at larger than 3-sigma  corners, we performed 500,000 
Monte-Carlo simulations. The Q-Q plots shown in Figure 13 
demonstrate that the models matc h well with the SPICE simulations. 
Figure 13 also shows a comparison  of the failure probabilities. The 
low failure probabilities of a SRAM cell are hard to verify due to 
computationally prohibitive number  of Monte-Carlo simulations.  
However, the table shows that even  at the very low probabilities, the 
models track the Monte-Carlo results very well.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS 
We proposed a framework to model the impact of random 
variations on SRAM yield. The paper developed several new criteria 
for characterizing the stability of a SRAM cell in the presence of 
external DC noise, and also during read and write operations. The 
proposed models provide a measure of the robustness of a cell and 
enable efficient estimation of the cell failure probability. The 
methods discussed in this work can be very useful in optimizing a 
memory cell to achieve better stability and higher yield.
