ABSTRACT
 
Designing an energy efficient power gating structure is an important 
and challenging task in Multi-Threshold CMOS (MTCMOS) circuit 
design. In order to achieve a very low power design, the large 
amount of energy consumed during mode transition in MTCMOS 
circuits should be avoided. In this paper, we propose an appropriate 
charge recycling technique to reduce energy consumption during the 
mode transition of MTCMOS circuits. The proposed method can 
save up to 46% of the mode transition energy while, in most cases, 
maintaining, or even improving, the wake up time of the original 
circuit. It also reduces the peak negative voltage value and the 
settling time of the ground bounce.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
As CMOS technology scales down, the supply voltage is reduced so 
as to avoid device failure due to high electric fields in the gate oxide 
and the conducting channel under the gate. Voltage scaling reduces 
the circuit power consumption because of the quadratic relationship 
between dynamic power consumption and supply voltage, but it also 
increases the delay of logic gates. To compensate the resulting 
performance loss, transistor threshold voltages are decreased, which 
causes exponential increase in the sub-threshold leakage current [1].  
MTCMOS technology provides low leakage and high 
performance operation by utilizing high speed, low Vt (LVT) 
transistors for logic cells and low leakage, high Vt (HVT) devices as 
sleep transistors. Sleep transistors disconnect logic cells from the 
supply and/or ground to reduce the leakage in the sleep mode. In this 
technology, also called power gating, the wake up latency and power 
plane integrity are key issues.  
Assume a sleep/wake up signal is supplied by an on-chip power 
management module. A key question is how to minimize energy 
consumption while doing the mode transition, i.e., when switching 
from active to sleep mode or vice versa. Another important question 
is how to minimize the time required to turn on the circuit upon  receiving the wake up signal since the length of the wake up time 
can affect the overall performance of the VLSI circuit. Furthermore, 
the large current flowing to ground when sleep transistors are turned 
on can become a major source of noise in the power distribution 
network, which can adversely impact the performance and/or 
functionality of the other parts of the circuit. Hence, there is a trade 
off between the generated noise due to the current flowing to ground 
and the transition time from the sleep mode to the active mode. 
Sleep transistors cause logic cells to slow down during the active 
mode of the circuit operation. This is due to the voltage drop across 
the functionally-redundant sleep transistors and the increase in the 
threshold voltage of logic cell transistors as a result of the body 
effect. The performance penalty of a sleep transistor depends on its 
size and the amount of current that goes through it. Several 
researchers have proposed methods for optimal sizing of sleep 
transistors in a given circuit to meet a performance constraint [2]-[4]. 
In [5], the authors propose a power gating structure to support an 
intermediate power-saving mode and the traditional power cut-off 
mode. The idea is to add a PMOS transistor in parallel with each 
NMOS sleep transistor. By applying zero voltage to the gate of the 
PMOS transistor, the circuit can be put in the intermediate power 
saving mode whereby leakage reduction and data retention are both 
realized. Furthermore, by transitioning through this intermediate 
mode while changing between sleep and active modes, the 
magnitude of power supply voltage fluctuations during power-mode 
transitions is reduced. In the cut-off mode, the gate of the PMOS 
transistor is connected to V
DD. 
None of these works attempt to minimize the power 
consumption during the sleep-to-active and active-to-sleep 
transitions, or reduce wake up time and the noise generated by the 
power gating structure. In contrast, we apply a charge recycling 
technique to minimize the power consumption during the mode 
transition in a power gating structure while maintaining, or 
sometimes even improving, the wake up time. We show that how the 
proposed technique also helps us reduce the ground bounce (GB) in 
the sleep to active transition.  
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2, 
we introduce the concept of using charge recycling technique in 
power gating MTCMOS circuits, and we find the optimal conditions 
to achieve the maximum Energy Saving Ratio (ESR). In section 3, 
we study the effect of the threshold voltages and sizing of the 
transistors used in the transmission gate (TG) on the saving ratio and 
wake up time of the circuit. In section 4 we analyze the influence of 
the proposed charge recycling technique on the wake up time, 
leakage and GB of the circuit. Section 5 represents the simulation 
results, and finally section 6 concludes the paper. 
2.  CHARGE RECYCLING TECHNIQUE 
Consider the configuration shown in Figure 1. There are two 
different blocks in the circuit; one is power-gated by an NMOS sleep 
transistor which connects the virtual ground, i.e., node G in

the figure, to the ground, whereas the other is power-gated by a 
PMOS sleep transistor which connects the virtual supply, i.e., node P 
in the figure, to the supply. During the active period, sleep transistors 
S
N and SP are in the linear region and the voltage values of the virtual 
ground and virtual supply are equal to 0 and V
DD, respectively. 
During the sleep time, sleep transistors S
N and SP are turned off, and 
since they are chosen to be high threshold devices, they allow very 
little subthreshold leakage current to flow through them. 
Now, if the duration of the sleep period is sufficiently long, all 
internal nodes of the gates in block C
1 and the virtual ground node, 
G, will be charged up to some voltage value very close to V
DD [6].  
This is due to G being floated and leakage current causing its voltage 
level to rise toward V
DD. Similarly, if the duration of the sleep period 
is long enough, all the internal nodes of C
2 and virtual supply node, 
P , will be discharged to some voltage value very close to 0. When 
the sleep-to-active transition edge arrives at the gates of the sleep 
transistors to turn them on, G starts to fall toward 0, whereas  P starts 
to rise toward V
DD. If we denote the total capacitance in the virtual 
ground and supply b y C
G and CP, respectively, we observe that 
during the active-to-sleep transition, C
G is charged up from 0 to VDD 
while C
P is discharged from VDD to 0. The situation is reversed for 
the sleep-to-active transition, that is, in this case C
G will be 
discharged from V
DD to 0, while CP will be charged to VDD from its 
initial value of 0. These charge and discharge events on the virtual 
ground and V
DD nodes are wasteful from a circuit energy dissipation 
point of view.  
Our goal is to reduce the energy as we switch between active and 
sleep modes of the circuit.  More precisely, we propose to use a 
charge recycling technique to reduce the switching power 
consumption during the active-to-sleep and sleep-to-active 
transitions by adding a TG between the virtual ground and supply 
nodes as shown in Figure 2.   The proposed charge recycling strategy 
works as follows.  
We turn on the TG (i) immediately before turning on the sleep 
transistors while going from sleep to active mode, and (ii) just after 
turning off the sleep transistors while going from active to sleep. By 
turning on the TG at the end of the sleep mode as the circuit is about 
to go from sleep to active mode, we allow charge sharing between 
the completely charged up capacitance C
G and the completely 
discharged capacitance C
P. After the charge recycling is completed, 
the common voltage of the virtual ground and virtual supply is  ?V
DD, 
where  ? is a positive real number less than 1. The value of  ? depends 
on the relative sizes of C
G and CP. As a result of this step, power 
consumption due to switching on the sleep transistors is reduced. 
This is because in this case we have a

transition from  ?V
DD to 0 at the virtual ground, and from  ?VDD to 
V
DD at the virtual supply; whereas in the conventional MTCMOS 
circuit without the charge recycling, the transition was from V
DD to 0 
and from 0 to V
DD at the virtual ground and supply nodes, 
respectively. A similar analysis proves that the charge recycling 
technique helps reduce power consumption in the transition from 
active to sleep mode as well. 
In the following, we calculate the maximum achievable power 
saving and the conditions we need to achieve this maximum saving. 
To do this, we consider two different transitions: sleep-to-active and 
active-to-sleep.  
Case A: Wake-up Transition  
In Figure 3, C
G and CP represent the total capacitance in the virtual 
ground and supply nodes, respectively. We assume that the sleep 
period is long enough such that C
G has had time to charge up to 
some value close to V
DD, while CP has had time to completely 
discharge to some small value close to 0. This is a good assumption 
in most circuits. Otherwise, the voltage of C
G and CP will be a 
function of the length of the sleep period. 
As stated earlier, to go from sleep mode to the active mode, 
instead of simply turning on sleep transistors, we first allow charge 
recycling between C
G and CP. To do that, we close switch M at the 
time t=t
a0. Assuming ideal charge sharing between CG and CP, the 
common voltage value of nodes G and P after charge sharing is 
calculated by equating the total charge in both capacitances before 
and right after charge recycling:

The common voltage value of the virtual ground and virtual 
supply at the end of the charge sharing is  ?V
DD. After the charge 
sharing is complete, i.e., at time t=t
a1, we open switch M, and then 
turn on the SN and SP sleep transistors. As a result, there will be a 
path from the virtual ground to the (actual) ground going through SN 
which forces C
G to be discharged to 0. We will also have a path from 
the virtual supply to the (actual) supply going through S
P which 
causes C
P to be charged to VDD.  If we neglect the energy 
consumption in the switch itself, for now,  the total energy drawn 
from the power supply is due to the process of charging capacitance 
C
P which can be obtained as follows:

Next we consider the transition from active to sleep. 
Case B: Sleep Transition  
Consider the circuit shown in Figure 3. As mentioned earlier, to go 
from active mode to the sleep mode, instead of simply turning off the 
sleep transistors, we do charge recycling between C
G and CP as soon 
as the circuit enters the sleep mode. In particular, we close switch M 
at t=t
s0 which is the time when we turn off sleep transistors. The 
voltage values of the virtual ground and virtual supply nodes at this 
time are 0 and V
DD, respectively. Assuming ideal charge sharing 
between C
G and CP, the common voltage value of nodes G and P 
after charge sharing is calculated by equating the total charge in both 
capacitances right before and after the charge sharing:

Based on the above equation, the common voltage value of the 
virtual ground and virtual supply at the end of the charge sharing is  
? V
DD. By the time the charge recycling is complete, t=ts1, we open 
the switch. After opening the switch, there is a leakage path from the 
power supply to the virtual ground going through logic block C
1 
which eventually causes C
G to be charged up to VDD. We also have a 
leakage path from the virtual supply to the ground going through 
logic block C
2 which eventually causes CP to be completely 
discharged into the ground.  Again, if we neglect the power 
consumption in the switch, the total energy consumed from the 
power supply is due to the charging up the capacitance C
G in this 
case, and we can calculate this energy consumption as follows:

where  X is defined as the ratio of the virtual ground capacitance to

G/CP. The optimum value for 
X  whi ch maxi mi zes  ESR(X) is obtained by equating the derivative of 
this ratio to zero which results in X=1, or C
G=CP. In other words, in 
order to obtain the best energy saving, we need to have  
equal capacitances in virtual ground and virtual supply. Then the 
maxi mum energy savi ng is: 
max 1()| 0.5XESR ESR X===  
(10) 
This means that we can obtain a maximum energy saving of 
50% by using the charge recycling method. However, considering 
the power needed to turn on or off the TG, the total saving ratio is 
less than 50%. Figure 4 shows an example of the balanced (i.e., 
C
G=CP) charge recycling operation when transitioning from sleep to 
active mode for an inverter chain in 70nm CMOS technology 
generated in HSPICE. In this figure we can see the virtual ground 
voltage, V
G, the virtual supply voltage, VP, and the charge recycling 
signal, V
CR.  
3.  THRESHOLD VOLTAGES AND SIZES 
OF TRANSISTORS IN TG 
All the equations we derived in the previous section were based 
on the assumption of having an ideal charge recycling process 
between C
G and CP. Under this scenario, we assume that no energy is 
consumed to switch the TG on and off. We also assume that the TG 
is ?ON? while the charge recycling is in process.

However, because of the dynamic power consumption in the TG, 
and also the possibility of having incomplete charge sharing (cf. 
section 3.1), this is not a perfect replacement in practice. In this 
section we study the effects of the TG threshold voltage and sizing 
on the energy saving ratio and the wake up time of the charge 
recycling configuration.  
3.1 Effect of Threshold Voltage 
We consider a more realistic charge recycling scenario where we 
replace the ideal switch with a practical circuit model of a CMOS 
TG. Next, we discuss the effect of transistor threshold voltages on 
the power saving and the delay of the circuit. 
 Consider the charge sharing configuration shown in Figure 5. 
To have a complete charge sharing, the TG has to stay ?ON? for the 
whole duration of the charge sharing process. In order to have this 
property, the absolute values of the threshold voltages of the N and P 
transistors of the TG have to be small enough. To guarantee this, the 
common final voltage value of virtual ground and virtual supply, i.e., 
V
f, has to satisfy at least one of the following two inequalities:  
?
? ?
? ?
??
?f
p
t f

V or
V
V
V,
,
 
(11) 
where  V
t,n and Vt,p denote threshold voltages of the NMOS and 
PMOS transistors in the TG accounting for the body effect. Notice 
that  V
f can be obtained from (1) for the active to sleep case and from 
(4) for the sleep to active case. The inequalities guarantees that at 
least one of the transistors in the TG remains ?ON? for the complete 
duration of charge sharing process. 
In the case of equal capacitive loads in virtual ground and virtual 
supply, C
G=CP, a complete charge sharing in both active-to-sleep 
and sleep-to-active cases results in a common final voltage value of 
V
f=VDD/2 , and (11) translates into  Min{Vt,n, |Vt,p|} ? VDD/2 . If this 
condition is not satisfied, the charge recycling is not complete, and 
the energy saving ratio (ESR) will be less than what we have 
predicted. In this case, if  V
tn=|Vtp|, we can simply use a pass 
transistor instead of a TG.

1 and C2 using a TG. 
 
3.2  Transmission Gate Sizing Effect  
Sizing of the TG is another factor that affects the ESR as well as the 
wake up time of the circuit. In case of the original configuration 
when there is not any charge recycling, the wake up time may be 
defined as the time between when we turn on the sleep transistors to 
when the voltage of the virtual ground reaches within 10% of its 
final value. However, in a circuit that uses charge recycling, the 
wake up time may be defined as the time between when we turn on 
the TG to when the virtual ground voltage goes below 10% of its 
final value. In the following discussion, we consider the effect of the 
dynamic power consumption of the TG on the energy saving ratio, 
ESR, which we previously calculated in section 2.  Figure 6 shows the TG along with its turn on circuit. Assume an 
input capacitance of  C
tg for the NMOS transistor of the TG and the 
same input capacitance for the PMOS transistor of the TG. In

each active-sleep-active cycle, we need to switch on the TG twice, 
once before turning the sleep transistors on, and once after turning 
them off. Every time we turn the TG on, we are actually turning on 
both NMOS and PMOS transistors in the TG, i.e., the switched 
capacitance is 2C
tg. Clearly, we turn off the TG after the charge 
sharing is complete. Therefore, we can calculate the dynamic energy 
consumption of the TG for one complete active-sleep cycle as 
follows: 
221

2tg total tg DD tg DDECVCV?=? ? =  (12) 
Therefore, to calculate the actual energy saving ratio (ESR), we 
need to subtract the correction ratio  E
tg-total/Etotal from the ideal ESR 
in (9). The correction ratio can be calculated as:

(13) 
This correction ratio is proportional to the size of the TG, since 
C
tg itself is proportional to the size of the TG. However, because 
there are usually too many gates connected to the virtual ground and 
virtual supply, C
G+CP is usually much larger than Ctg, i.e., the 
correction ratio is usually in the order of few percents which makes 
the actual ESR to be less than the ideal ESR, 50%, by only a few 
percentage points.  
By increasing the size of the TG, we can speed up the charge 
sharing process, and as a result, reduce the wake up time; however, 
this will also increase the correction ratio given in (13),  hence, 
decreasing the energy saving ratio of the circuit. Therefore, there is a 
trade off between the wake up time and energy saving ratio.  
4.  WAKE UP TIME, LEAKAGE AND 
GROUND BOUNCE ANALYSIS 
We analyze three important issues in power gating structures, 
namely the wake up time, leakage currents, and GB for our proposed 
charge recycling MTCMOS configuration.  
4.1  Wake Up Time  
In charge recycling MTCMOS, the larger the TG size is, the smaller 
the wake up time of the circuit is. The increased size, however, 
increases the dynamic power consumption of the TG. If we use a 
large enough TG, we can make the charge sharing time small enough 
such that we obtain a wake up time which is as small as, or 
sometimes even less than, that of the original circuit where we do not 
use any charge recycling. However, as seen from equation (12), by 
increasing the size of the TG, we are also increasing its energy 
consumption. Our experiments on a number of real circuits 
demonstrate that the size we need for the TG in order to maintain, or 
sometimes improve, the original wake up time is such that we will 
loose only a very small percentage of the ideal ESR.

4.2 Leakage 
Consider Figure 7 a where r1 and r2 represent resistances of logic 
blocks C
1 and C2, respectively, and RN and RP represent resistances 
of NMOS and PMOS sleep transistors, respectively. For 
conventional MTCMOS configuration, during the sleep period, there 
exist two different paths from V
DD to ground. Since C1 and C2 
consist of LVT transistors, and sleep transistors are HVT transistors, 
we can assume that R
N, RP >> r1, r2.  Without loss of generality, and 
to simplify the discussion, we assume that R
N=RP=R. The total 
resistance from the power supply to the ground is thus R
to tal-con v.=R/2, 
and the leakage power consumption is calculated as: 
R

Next we calculate leakage power consumption for the charge 
recycling (CR) MTCMOS configuration. As seen in Figure 7 b, in 
this case, there is a new path from V
DD to the ground going through 
r
1, RTG and r2. As we mentioned earlier, since C1 and C2 consist of 
LVT transistors, r
1 and r2 are small resistances. In order to avoid 
having a high leakage path from the power supply to the ground, we 
have to make RTG as large as possible; this is possible by using 
HVT transistors in the TG. Let?s assume that  R
TG=nR for some  n. 
Knowing that R >> r
1, r2, and by doing  ?-Y transformation for r1, 
RTG and RP, we arrive at the new resistive network shown in Figure 
7 c where r

As seen from (17), the leakage power consumption has increased by 
a factor of (1+1/2n) compared to the conventional power gating 
method. If R
TG=2R,  n is equal to 2, and we have a 25% increase in 
the leakage power. If the sleep period of the circuit is small, then this 
25% increase in leakage energy consumption is negligible compared 
to the 50% switching energy saving that we achieve by using the 
charge recycling MTCMOS structure. On the other hand, if the sleep 
period is very long, we must use larger  n by increasing resistance of 
the TG. This is possible by choosing transistors with smaller W/L 
ratios in the TG (which is also beneficial from the layout area point 
of view.) The potential disadvantage is that the charge cycling will 
take longer time to complete now since TG will have a larger ?ON? 
resistance. 
4.3  Ground Bounce  
Ground and power line bounces are one of the most important design 
concerns with regard to power gating structures [6][7]. GB occurs in 
power gating structures at the sleep to active transition edge.

Consider Figure 8. After we turn on the sleep transistor at the end 
of the sleep period, a large amount of current flows into the 
ground. We adopt a simple RL model for the purpose of GB 
analysis. Because of the large di/dt at the turn-on time, there is a 
large voltage, Ldi/dt, appearing across the inductance. We next 
study the effect of the proposed charge recycling technique on the 
GB of the circuit.

We turn on the sleep transistor at t=0, and assume that the initial 
voltage of C
G at this time is V0, i.e., VG(t=0)=V0.  Based on the 
results of reference [8], the positive peak value of the GB occurs 
during the time when S
N operates in the saturation region. Although 
the peak value does not depend on voltage V
0, it depends on R, L, 
C
G, VTn and VDD values. Therefore, we expect that the proposed 
charge recycling technique, which simply changes V
0 from VDD to 
V
DD/2, does not change the positive peak value of the GB. However, 
the negative peak value of the GB, and the GB settling time both 
depend on V
0 [8]. Furthermore, both of these quantities decrease as 
V
0 is reduced. Therefore, both the negative peak value, and the 
settling time of the GB voltage are expected to decrease for the 
charge recycling MTCMOS. Degrees of improvement in the 
negative peak and settling time are dependent on the relative values 
of L, C
G, R, VDD, and the sleep transistor parameters. Figure 9 
compares GB waveforms resulting from conventional and charge 
recycling power gating structures for an inverter chain in 70nm 
CMOS technology. As expected, the positive peak value remains the 
same for both cases; however, the negative peak value and the 
settling time are smaller for the charge- recycling MTCMOS 
structure.

Table 1 shows the experimental results in terms of the wake up time 
and energy consumption for a number of benchmarks when we use 
the conventional MTCMOS as well as the charge recycling 
MTCMOS. We observe from the table that energy saving during the 
mode transition is always more than 40% while the wake up time 
usually remains the same or improves slightly. However, for some 
cases e.g., C1908, we see that the energy saving ratio is 46% which 
is still more than 40%, but the wake up time has been increased by 
about 4%.

6.  CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper we introduced the concept of charge recycling (CR) in 
MTCMOS circuits. We showed that by applying the proposed CR 
technique to the MTCMOS circuits, we can save up to 50% of the 
mode transition energy while maintaining the wake up time of the 
original circuit. We also showed that by using the proposed 
technique, we can reduce the negative peak voltage value and the 
settling time of the gr ound bounce. Although leakage in the sleep 
mode of the circuit can go up as a result of the CR structure, the 
effect can be very well controlled by sizing down the TG, by 
judiciously selecting the HVT level to be used for both sleep 
transistors and charge recycling TG transistors in the first place, or 
even by using higher V
t values for the transistors in the TG 
compared to those for the sleep transistors. Since the subthreshold 
leakage current of a MOS transistor is exponentially dependent on 
the threshold voltage of the transistor, a slight increase in the 
threshold voltage value of the TG will result in a large difference in 
the resistance value of the gate, or in a large  n value in equation (17), 
which makes the increase in the leakage power consumption 
negligible.
